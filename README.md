- Create post likes structure
- Separate some backend structures:
    * Add Request validators
    * maybe reconfigure and reconsider routes
- Queries seems to be duplicated (idk how but will get back to it)
    * maybe cache them ?
    * n+1 query
- View renders slow/sometimes not work at first try(???)
- Update seeder, implement seeder, maybe some Rules
- Create admin panel (include package?)
- Implement live chat (livewire)
